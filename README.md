## Markdown:
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## Examples:
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

## Emphasis:
*This text will be italic*
**This text will be bold**
  
Etc...
